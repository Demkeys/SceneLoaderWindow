# SceneLoaderWindow

Scene Loader Window is a simple Unity Editor tool that provides you with easy access to all the scenes in your project. 
You can even add, delete or rename scenes while the tool window is open, and then window updates accordingly.
 
NOTES:
- Make sure this script is in the Editor folder.
- The scenes do not need to be added in Build Settings.
