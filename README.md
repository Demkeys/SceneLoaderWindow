# SceneLoaderWindow

Scene Loader Window is a simple Unity Editor tool that provides you with easy access to all the scenes in your project. 

 
NOTES:
- Make sure this script is in the Editor folder.
- The scenes do not need to be added in Build Settings.
- You can add, delete or rename scenes while the tool window is open, and then window updates accordingly.
